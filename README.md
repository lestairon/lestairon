# Fernando Nieto

**Backend Engineer · System Architecture · AI Pipelines**

5+ years building production systems in regulated (HIPAA) and high-availability environments. I specialize in billing workflows, event-driven architectures, data migrations, and background processing — and lately in building real AI pipelines that go beyond toy demos: async queues, semantic clustering, multi-source data collection, and multi-agent orchestration.

## Projects

### [MIRA](https://github.com/mira-js/MIRA) — Market Intelligence Research Assistant
> Ask a question. Get structured insight from 7 sources at once.

MIRA helps indie founders and SaaS teams understand what real users are struggling with — without manually reading through Reddit threads, HN comments, and review sites.

You type a query like *"invoice automation pain points for freelancers"* and MIRA fans out to Reddit, Hacker News, IndieHackers, RSS feeds, G2, Trustpilot, and Product Hunt simultaneously. It runs each result through a multi-stage AI pipeline: per-item LLM extraction → Jina AI semantic embeddings → cosine-similarity clustering → synthesis report. Cross-source correlation is the key filter: a complaint that surfaces independently across Reddit, G2, and HN is a real signal; a single thread is just noise.

The whole pipeline runs async via BullMQ + Redis — long queries (25-50 items/source) don't block the API. One `docker compose up` brings up Postgres, Redis, the API, and a Svelte 5 dashboard.

Open-core: self-hosted under AGPL v3.0 · cloud tier for teams.

### [DeepDiver](https://github.com/lestairon/deepdiver) — *private for now* — True Winrate Calculator
> Pre-computed game analytics. Never computed on-request.

Turborepo monorepo with dedicated packages for API, crawler, analyzer, Riot API client, rate limiter, and shared contracts. BullMQ pipelines batch all metric computation in the background; results are served from Redis on every request. File-based canonical memory keeps agent context lean across sessions.
